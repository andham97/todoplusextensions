# TodoPlusExtensions

This extensions builds on the Todo+ extension and adds some overview generation behaviour to get an overview over completed tasks within a given timeframe.

## Features

Allows use of `@overview` tags to generate (Alt+G) a collection of items both started and done. Items can be excluded from the overview with `@exclude` (Alt+E). It allows for general overviews with all started and done tasks, or to specify a from date (to present) `@overview(YY-MM-dd hh:mm)` same format as Todo+ uses.
